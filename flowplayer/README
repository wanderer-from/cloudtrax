The splash players are copied exactly as they are in CloudTrax.
In order to test them, you must run the demo.sh script to remove CloudTrax-specific code.
Example:
	../tools/demo.sh splash.html

After doing so, open the file called demo_splash.html and you will be able to see a cleaned version of the code.
